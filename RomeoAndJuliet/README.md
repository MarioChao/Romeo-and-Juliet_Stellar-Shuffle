# Romeo And Juliet
The Game of Splitting Up and Never Meeting Again

## Instruction
Run the main.cpp file.

There will be 8 items shuffling in a 4x2 manner.
The game will initially start with 1 shuffle.
As you progress and guess correctly, the rounds will get longer and longer.
If you guess it wrong, you will lose a try.
Once you lose all 3 tries, you will restart from the beginning.

## Credits
Inspired by GD Level "LIMBO", especially the final wave section with the shuffling keys.
The title "Romeo and Juliet" is a play by William Shakespeare, and it is also adapted into a musical.
