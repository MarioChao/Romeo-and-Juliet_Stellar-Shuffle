# Romeo And Juliet
The Game of Splitting Up and Never Meeting Again

## Instruction
Run the main.cpp file.

There will be 8 items shuffling in a 4x2 manner.
<br>
The game will initially start with 1 shuffle.
<br>
As you progress and guess correctly, the rounds will get longer and longer.
<br>
If you guess it wrong, you will lose a try.
<br>
Once you lose all 3 tries, you will restart from the beginning.

### Challenges I face
Making the program stop (sleep) for a specific time.
<br>
I don't know about delay functions or libraries in C++ before this project, so it was a challenge to search up and find the solution.

## Credits
Inspired by GD Level "LIMBO", especially the final wave section with the shuffling keys.

The title "Romeo and Juliet" is a play by William Shakespeare, and it is also adapted into a musical.
